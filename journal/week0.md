# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

For this week's homework, I made some updates to my existing AWS account. Usually I always used my root account whenever I played around with AWS, but I finally created an Admin account to be used instead of always using the root.

In addition to creating an Admin account, I also set up a budget and a billing alarm as well as a service health alert through EventBridge. I've never used EventBridge so that was interesting to be able to play around with that service. Since I've used AWS some in the past, the AWS CLI was already set up on my machine.
